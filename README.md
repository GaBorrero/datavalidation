# Data Validation and Conditional Formatting

This is a small exercise in data validation and conditional formatting in the invoice register, very useful for any procedure that needs to increase its agility without affecting information control. In it, you can observe the validation rule (one among several established in the file) with the cell's usage instructions and the changes in its format, which depend on conditions such as its value, blank value, and/or duplication.
